## Project Components

### Configurable Logic Block (CLB)
The main component of this project is the design and implementation of a Configurable Logic Block, which typically includes:
- Look-Up Tables (LUTs) for implementing combinational logic
- Flip-flops for sequential logic
- Multiplexers for signal routing
- Configuration memory (SRAM-based)

### SRAM Component
The project includes SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) design elements, which are used for:
- Configuration storage
- Data memory
- Programming the CLB functionality
